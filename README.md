2. Summary
---

The World War II Flashcard Application was developed for this subject’s 2nd Assignment. It was created in Android Studio, and thus, utilizes the Kotlin programming language. 

The app quizzes users on their knowledge on World War II by asking a few questions, then gives an overall score based on how many questions the user answered correctly. Furthermore, it allows users to review the questions afterwards to note the answers to each question, hopefully aiding in their studies. 

The application is fully functional and has gone through extensive manual, as well as automated testing using GitHub Actions.

3. Design Thought Process
---

When developing this application, I took careful consideration to allow for:

1. User Friendliness: This application provides clear instructions on how to utilise and get the most out of it.
   
2. Simplicity: The design is simple and clean, taking care not to overwhelm users with visual clutter, and allow them to focus on the subject matter.

4. GitHub
---
Pushing Code

GitHub was the main platform hosting this application during the development cycle, and whenever version updates were release, the code was pushed to GitHub to allow my lecturers to monitor its progress.
GitHub Actions:
I made use of an automated workflow action to allow simplify the build and deployment cycle.

The makes certain that my application is automatically built and tested, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files.

6. Things I Learnt During Development
---

Challenges

I encountered several challenges during my time spent on this application, including:

1. Challenge 1: The transferring of information from one screen to another.
   - Solution: Re-reading the module manual and finding examples to aid in developing my solution, as well as some independent research.
   
2. Challenge 2: The general programming for the loops used to control the main program.
   - Solution: Critical thinking as well as reading the foundation of loops in the module manual from another module (IPRG5111).

I learnt a lot during my time spent on this application and I can only hope my knowledge going forward further accumulates.

7. Potential Improvements
---

Possible Future Additions to the Application

- Providing users information on why each question is either true or false in the review mode. (While referencing the sources of course).
- Providing a means for users to instantly retry the test after they’ve entered review mode.
- Prevent users from being able to accidently provide two answers for a single question.
